### [*PowDew*: Detecting Counterfeit Powdered Food Products using a Commodity Smartphone](/headers/powdew/index.md)

Surveillance of counterfeit powdered food products, including infant formulas, spices, and dietary supplements, poses significant threats to public health. We propose PowDew, a novel system for detecting counterfeit powdered food products using only a commodity smartphone. PowDew captures the interaction between powder and water droplets (i.e., the droplet motion) for counterfeit detection.

### [*RampScope*: Ramp-level Localization of Shared Mobility Devices using Sidewalk Ramps](rampscope/)
<img src="../images/rampscope/intro.png" alt="RampScope" style="width:200px; float:left; margin-right:20px;">
The low accuracy of GPS in urban areas causes significant real-world problems for shared mobility devices (SMDs), such as reduced usability for locating these devices. To address this issue, we propose RampScope, a ramp-level localization system that leverages the physical uniqueness of sidewalk ramps. RampScope utilizes a single gyroscope to capture the distinctive characteristics of sidewalk ramps and demonstrates its feasibility across three different types of mobility devices.
