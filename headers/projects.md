### [*PowDew*: Detecting Counterfeit Powdered Food Products using a Commodity Smartphone](powdew/)
<img src="../images/powdew/intro.png" alt="PowDew" style="width:200px; float:left; margin-right:20px;">
 We are witnessing a surge in the reported cases of counterfeit liquid products in the market including olive oil, honey, and alcohol. We propose LiquidHash, a novel counterfeit liquid food product detection system that only requires the use of a commodity smartphone to detect adulterated liquid products without opening the bottles. LiquidHash works by detecting and tracking the shape and movement of air bubbles that form inside the bottles.
