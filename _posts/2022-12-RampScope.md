I am Jonghyuk Yun, currently pursuing an MS/Ph.D. integrated program in [Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University](https://ee.yonsei.ac.kr/ee/index.do), working with [Prof. Jun Han](https://www.junhan.org/).


My research interest involves a novel application in the field of mobile computing, particularly focused on sensing systems as well as security.
